## General Information
- This project was undertaken as part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. It intends to answer the following questions:
- Which neighbourhoods are most popular?
-	Does price vary by neighbourhood? Do reviews? Is there a relationship between the two?
-	Is there a strong relationship between accommodates, beds and bedrooms?
-	Can we predict price based on other factors about the Airbnb?
