## General Information
This project was undertaken as part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. It intends to answer the following questions:
- Which neighbourhoods are most popular?
-	Does price vary by neighbourhood? Do reviews? Is there a relationship between the two?
-	Is there a strong relationship between accommodates, beds and bedrooms?
-	Can we predict price based on other factors about the Airbnb?


## Technologies Used
- pandas - version 1.0.5
- matplotlib - version 3.2.2
- numpy - version 1.18.5
- seaborn - version 0.10.1
- plotly - version 5.10.0
- sklearn - version 0.23.1
- scipy - version 1.5.0

Python 3 is used throughout the notebook.


## Files
The files included are listings.csv, where the data is held, and 'Udacity Project 1' Jupyter Notebook, which contains all the code.


## Project Status
Project is: complete for the purpose of the nanodegree. The blog related to this code can be found here: [add blog link once ready].
