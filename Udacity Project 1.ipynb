    "The purpose of this project is for you to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. You can gain some inspiration from Robert's posts here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an overview of the main steps in this project, following the CRISP-DM process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.\n",
    "Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.\n",
    "Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.\n",
    "Evaluate your results.\n",
    "Share your insights with stakeholders in a blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your dataset, you will choose 3 questions you aspire to answer from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Pick a dataset, as mentioned on the previous page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare data:\n",
    "Gather necessary data to answer your questions\n",
    "Handle categorical and missing data\n",
    "Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them\n",
    "Analyze, Model, and Visualize\n",
    "Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them\n",
    "4) Communicate your business insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind\n",
    "Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Deliverables\n",
    "There are two deliverables that are required for project completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Github repository for your code.\n",
    "A blog post of your findings.\n",
    "Your Github repository must have the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "A README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgments.\n",
    "Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.\n",
    "You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary.\n",
    "For the blog post, pick a platform of your own choice. For example, it can be on your website, a Medium post (Josh's sample report on How Do YOU Become A Developer?), or a Github blog post. Your blog must provide the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear and engaging title and image.\n",
    "Your questions of interest.\n",
    "Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual."
